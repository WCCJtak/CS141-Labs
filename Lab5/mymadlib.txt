A <CREATURE> walked up to a <FRUIT> stand
And then they said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any <PLURAL-NOUN>?
The man said, no, we just sell <NOUN>

The <CREATURE> said, I'll pass

'Till the very next day (bom, bom, bom, bom, bom babom)
When the <CREATURE> walked up to the <FRUIT> stand
And then they said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey (bam bam bam), got any <PLURAL-NOUN>?
The man said, no, like I said yesterday
We just sell <NOUN>, okay?
Why not give it a try?
The <CREATURE> said, goodbye.
