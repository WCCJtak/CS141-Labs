    * whether they receive a salary or are paid hourly.
    * If the worker is paid a salary, they will need to input the amount.
    * If the worker is paid hourly, they will need to input their pay rate
    * and the number of hours they worked. The program will then calculate
    * and display the gross and net pay. This process will be repeated for
    * each employee until sufficient number of employees has done the process.
